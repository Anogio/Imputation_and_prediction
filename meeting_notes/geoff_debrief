ADDITION AUJOURDHUI: AGGREGATION DES PREDICTIONS, faire la moyenne dans le domaine des prédicteurs linéairs (ie log(p/(1-p)) pas sur les probas directement

Cut models
Line-by-line prediction -> particular way of scoring because when new patient must be possible
smaller dataset + outliers / skewed 
Principle analysis (loss function formally defined -> expected difference in various cases for multivariate normal data)

Pooling the predictions from multiple imputation: finding the minimax estimator? that is, get a 0-1 prediction from the multiple probabilities + cost of errors 
Cost of TP and FP? ask doctors

Transforming the covariates to make them more normal? -> better fit for the imputation -> maybe do it more formally, optimizing the likelihood of the full cases by picking transformations,
maybe even nonparaetricaly with splines or whatnot to transform the variables

GAM : link to mice? (in the packages)
Dissertation: start with the data!


Hard but worth: FORMALIZE THE MATH (loss function, models, nonparametric stuff)

Motivate with real workd issue -> data, explain why data useful -> full description of the data -> overview of the  analysis (what we're gona do here is imputation)
-> issue no existing methodology so we develop an ew one (idea explain why we go out of our way to explain something not exactly related to the data) ->
illustrative prediction (comparison of methods) 
Also, keep in mind to lay the basics of imputation, etc (Rubin's rules, MI)
One chapter about methodology + maybe illustrate with some simple datasets (maybe even using subsamples of the trauma dataset so you don't have to present new data) + really explain why it's a good aproach and we need it
And at the end, results

R code in the diss: R help manual-style doc in appendix, maybe open-source the code

Maybe read Rubin's book
Maybe check out :http://journals.sagepub.com/home/smj

In the diss, underline the novelty if there is some (eg imputation with reserved data)

+ autre possibilité: faire du MICE en metant à chaque fois une ligne du test sur le train -> beaucoup de calcul mais propre

NEXT MEETING, monday July 16th 2PM + draft chapter
