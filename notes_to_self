## EDA

Profile of the variables:
- Sp02 and Glasgow very different from gaussians. The others: OK (though some are artificially discretized)
- But Glasgow: almost no missing values (0.3%) -> no strong impact
- Sp02: strong correlation between missingness of this variable, and shock -> in final eval, we use the missingness of Sp02 as a variable. Not so for the others
- Sex, BMI and Age: no direct ocrrelation with shock but allows to control for these variables (e.g., males naturally have more Hb than females, which should be taken into account)
- Not a lot of missing data overall but some columns do have quite a lot (~15%)
