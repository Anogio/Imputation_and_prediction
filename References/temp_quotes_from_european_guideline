Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients [5, 6]

well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock [44–46]

studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock [47, 48]

While blood loss may sometimes be obvious, neither visual estimation nor physiological parameters are good guides to the degree of bleeding [79]

** In: Clinical Gestalt and the Prediction of Massive Transfusion after Trauma**

'Predefined massive transfusion (MT) protocols initiate a sequence of events in trauma
centers that facilitate rapid and on-going delivery of blood products to critically injured patients.'

'a more reliable algorithm is needed to identify and treat these severely injured patients earlier.'

'The TASH (Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage) score uses seven independent variables to identify patients who will require a MT. 
The variables are weighted and rely on laboratory values that may make the scoring system difficult to apply in a real-time fashion at some trauma centers.'
