In addition to simulated data, we want to make some tests on real-world data. The Traumabase data is not adapted for this use, because it has missing data (while we want a dataset where we know the full data, in order to add missing values ourselves and see the effects). In addition, it has a binary response which makes it harder to evaluate the prediction.

Instead, we use the Abalone \cite{nash1994abalone} dataset. It consists in measurements on abalone (sea snails) shells where the goal is to predict their age. It has 4177 observations, 7 numerical covariates and one categorical covariate. We keep only the numerical ones. The dataset is fully observed. 

In addition, there is a strong correlation between all the pairs of variables ($>0.8$).
